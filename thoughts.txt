Notes: 
    Currently I am having issues with dish usage and waiting food. It seems that there is never a substantial dent made in the dirty dishes
    I am assuming this is because the timing is not properly set up 
    REMEMBER: DURING RUSH IVE HAD TO DO BACK TO BACK SIDES. this would mean in the time it takes for me to finish making a chow mein, They fully went through a rice.
    Serving is quicker than paying, so maybe don't take that into accout
    too many servings for sides.
    Determin different batch sizes for different items? C1,M1,R1 vs everything else.
    Figure out teriyaki and rice 
    Think if less dishes need to be done or more time doing other things. - Rice and Teri might help with this, so maybe start there

Plan: 
    During a rush I am making sides back to back -> Lets assume that they are calling food when there are 6 servings left
    -> for M1 during a rush I am making 3s which is 36 servigns (assuming propper serving size) - > 
    this would put us at 30 servings before the next batch is called -> generally i have a little time after rice. 
    but not after M1 -> so the 21 - 6 servings of rice can be finished in less than 6 minutes during a rush -> 
    This would mean we are going through sides at roughly 15/6 servings a minute, so bassically 3 of at least just rice
    I feel like roughly the same for M1 -> go through a 3 in less than 7~8 minutes -> 30/8 = 3.~ so about 6 customers a minute at peak rush
    --> but the Orange would not be able to keep up? is the ratio off? Less Orange?
